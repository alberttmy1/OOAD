Comments:
If an adventurer was in a room with treasure they could hava chance to get it however they didn't stay locked to that room in order to continue to roll for treasure hence
it was harder to get a ending by getting all treasures.

If an adventurer got a teleport item we had them teleport immediately when their turn came up instead of having them have a option.
