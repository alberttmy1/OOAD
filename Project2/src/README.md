Notes:

The Sneakers ability: when they are in a room with a creature they have a 50% chance to fight it, however we have that hero not move from that fight
it will just avoid fighting it at that instance.

In the GameEngine the run() fuction is a void and will only run once outprinting the outputs of the game. 
If you want to runt the game 30 times you would need to change it to a int and uncomment lines 454-460 and in the Main file the functions and print statements to determine the endings are commented. Befere you run the game comment out line 4 in the Main file.
